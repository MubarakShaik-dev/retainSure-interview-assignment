## Brief Notes About Your Approach
My approach focused on creating a simple, robust, and maintainable solution by adhering to the principles of clean architecture and separation of concerns.

Architecture: The application is split into three main components:

main.py: Handles the API routing and request/response logic using Flask.

storage.py: Manages all data operations. It acts as a single source of truth for the URL data, abstracting the storage mechanism from the main application.


utils.py: Contains helper functions for URL validation and short code generation, keeping the main application logic clean.


Concurrency: To handle concurrent requests properly, all access to the shared, in-memory data store is protected by a threading.Lock. This ensures that operations like creating a new URL or incrementing a click count are atomic, preventing race conditions.


Data Storage: A simple Python dictionary serves as the in-memory database, as requested. The data structure for each entry stores not only the original URL but also the creation timestamp and the click counter, fulfilling the analytics requirement.

Error Handling: The application includes specific error handlers for 400 (Bad Request) and 404 (Not Found) errors. This ensures the API provides clear, JSON-formatted error messages instead of default HTML error pages, which is a best practice for API design.


Testing: The pytest suite covers all core functionality, error cases, and edge cases, such as providing an invalid URL or a missing JSON key. The tests verify status codes, response data, and side effects like click counter increments.
